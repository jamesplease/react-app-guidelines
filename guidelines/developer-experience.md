## Prettier

Prettier lets you spend less time on things that don't have an impact on your app, like the formatting of your code, giving you more time to focus on
the things that do have an impact.

CRA provides [an excellent guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/setting-up-your-editor#formatting-code-automatically) that
allows you to set up Prettier in a way that works for all contributors to your project.

## ESLint

Prettier is an excellent tool for formatting code, but it doesn't help catch JavaScript errors. I find that Prettier works best in conjunction with
a lightweight ESLint configuration.
