# JS Guidelines

#### Lodash

Lodash has a huge community of users, but it suffers from its arguments being in the wrong order.

Lodash FP is an option for solving the issue of arguments, but it introduces new
problems: fewer people have heard of it or used it, and its documentation is not
as easily accessible.

Lodash chaining is quite convenient, and I find it to be the best way to write
functional code using regular Lodash. However, it is not without its flaws. Refer

for more.

#### TypeScript

I'm new to TypeScript, so I don't have much to say about it. I'm hopeful that it will provide
benefits for projects that are intended to be maintained for long periods of time, which is why I am
interested in using it in my apps.

But I am still learning about it.
