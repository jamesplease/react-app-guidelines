# React App Guidelines

> Last updated: Nov. 6th, 2018

I frequently find myself creating new React apps, both professionally for Netflix and for side projects. There's a
considerable amount of set up that goes into building new apps, and sometimes I forget my preferences.

That's where this guide comes in. It's a list of libraries, configuration, and settings that I try to follow when building
React apps.

> Heads up! These guidelines aren't intended to reflect any "correct" way to do things, or anything like that. This
> really is just a list of things for me to remember. If you find it useful, too, then that's great!
