# react-app-guidelines

> Last updated: Nov. 5th, 2018

I frequently find myself creating new React apps, both professionally for Netflix and for side projects. There's a
considerable amount of set up that goes into building new apps, and sometimes I forget my preferences.

That's where this guide comes in. It's a list of libraries, configuration, and settings that I try to follow when building
React apps.
