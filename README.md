# react-app-guidelines

I frequently find myself creating new React apps. This is a set of guidelines I follow when building new apps.

> Note: is guidelines the right term? I'm not sure.

### Creating a New App

These days, I typically begin with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), or CRA for short.

Is CRA perfect? Perhaps not. Does it have all of the decisions that I would make if I made my own build step? Perhaps not.

But it works well, and it removes reponsibility for managing additional code outside of my apps. Lastly, it is widely
used, so it should have a low onboarding cost for additional developers.
